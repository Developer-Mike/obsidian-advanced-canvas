## Support
Please consider supporting the plugin. There are many hours of work and effort behind it. The two easiest ways to support the plugin are either by starring ⭐ the repository or by donating any amount on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/X8X27IA08) ❤️. Thank you!

## Full Metadata Cache Support
Advanced Canvas enables .canvas files to be indexed by the metadata cache. This means that there is now full compatibility with the graph view, outgoing links and backlinks. You can even enable (optional) the creation of an outgoing link if two embeds in a canvas are connected by an edge. This feature brings the full power of Obsidian's linking system to the canvas file format.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Developer-Mike/obsidian-advanced-canvas/main/assets/edge-metadata-cache.png" alt="Outgoing Link Using An Edge Example"/>
</details>

### Technical Details
- The file cache of a .canvas file now contains a value for the hash key (Generated from the filepath) instead of an empty string
  - Check the `app.metadataCache.fileCache[<filepath>]` object to see the changes
- The metadata cache is located in the `app.metadataCache` object - the same object that is used by Obsidian for markdown files
  - e.g. `app.metadataCache.getCache`/`app.metadataCache.getFileCache` now works with .canvas files
  - The `position` object which is found inside metadata cache entries now contains a new key `nodeId` for .canvas files
  - The metadata cache entry for a .canvas file now contains a new key `nodes` which is an object of type `{ [nodeId: string]: MetadataCacheEntry }` - this allows for other plugins to access the full metadata cache for single nodes. The `MetadataCacheEntry` object is the same as for markdown files (even created with the same function - 1:1 compatibility)
- The resolved links object now has entries for .canvas files
  - The `app.metadataCache.resolvedLinks` object values for .canvas files are implemented in the exact same way as for markdown files

## Better Default Settings
- Enforce all new nodes to be aligned to the grid
- Customize default text node size

</details>

## Custom Styles
Custom style attributes for nodes and edges can easily be added.

1. Create a new CSS snippet in your vault
   - To do this, navigate to `Settings > Appearance > *scroll down* > CSS snippets` and click on the folder icon to open the snippets folder
   - Create a new CSS file (e.g. `my-fancy-node-style.css`)
2. Add the custom style attribute
   - Open the CSS file and add the following code and replace the values how you like. The format needs to be **YAML** and needs to contain the same keys as in this example. The amount of options can be adjusted as needed (minimum of one option is required). The `icon` key should contain the id of the icon you want to use. You can find the icons on [lucide.dev](https://lucide.dev/icons/)
   - Change the `@advanced-canvas-node-style` to `@advanced-canvas-edge-style` if you want to add a custom style attribute for edges
    ```css
    /* @advanced-canvas-node-style
    key: validation-state
    label: Validation State
    options: 
      - 
        label: Stateless
        value: null
        icon: circle-help

      - 
        label: Approved
        value: approved
        icon: circle-check

      - 
        label: Pending
        value: pending
        icon: circle-dot

      - 
        label: Rejected
        value: rejected
        icon: circle-x
    */
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There needs to be **one** option with the value null

3. Add the CSS styling
   - In the same (or another) CSS file, add the styling for the custom style attribute
    ```css
    .canvas-node[data-<YOUR-CUSTOM-STYLE-KEY>="<VALUE>"] {
      /* Your custom styling */
    }
    ```
    in **my** case:
    ```css
    .canvas-node[data-validation-state] .canvas-node-content::after {
      content: "";

      position: absolute;
      top: 10px;
      right: 10px;

      font-size: 1em;
    }

    .canvas-node[data-validation-state="approved"] .canvas-node-content::after {
      content: "✔️";
    }

    .canvas-node[data-validation-state="pending"] .canvas-node-content::after {
      content: "⏳";
    }

    .canvas-node[data-validation-state="rejected"] .canvas-node-content::after {
      content: "❌";
    }
    ```
4. **Enable** the CSS snippet in the settings and enjoy your new custom style attribute!
    <br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Developer-Mike/obsidian-advanced-canvas/main/assets/custom-style-attribute-example.png" alt="Custom Style Attribute Example"/>

**Take a look at the whole file [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Developer-Mike/obsidian-advanced-canvas/main/assets/example-custom-node-style.css)**

## Variable Breakpoints
Add breakpoints to nodes to change at which zoom factor the node's content gets unrendered.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Due to performance reasons, custom breakpoints get cached and are only re-fetched when the canvas gets reloaded. This means that changes in the CSS snippet won't be applied immediately (Only after a reopening of the canvas).

Create a new CSS snippet in your vault (And enable it in the settings)
```css	
/* Any CSS selector can be used (As long as the .canvas-node element has the CSS variable defined) */
.canvas-node[data-shape="pill"] {
    /* The zoom factor at which the node's content gets unrendered (Zoom level can reach from 1 to -4) */
    --variable-breakpoint: 0.5;
}
```

## Z-Ordering Control
Change z-ordering of nodes using the context menu.

<details>
    <summary>Z-Ordering Control Example</summary>
    <img src="./assets/z-ordering-control.png" alt="Z-Ordering Control Example"/>
</details>

## Custom Colors
Add custom colors to the color picker. You can add them using the following css snippet:
```css
body {
    /* Where X is the index of the color in the palette */
    /* The colors 1-6 are already used by Obsidian */
    --canvas-color-X: 0, 255, 0; /* RGB */
}
```

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Developer-Mike/obsidian-advanced-canvas/main/assets/custom-colors.png" alt="Custom Colors In Palette"/>
</details>

## Presentation Mode
In presentation mode, you can navigate through the nodes using the arrow keys or the PageUp/PageDown keys (Compatible with most presentation remotes). The different slides/nodes are connected using arrows. If you want to have multiple arrows pointing from the same node, you can number them in the order you want to navigate through them. While in presentation mode, the canvas is in readonly mode (So [better readonly](#better-readonly) effects the presentation mode as well!). You can exit the presentation mode using the `ESC` key or the corresponding command. If you want to continue the presentation from the last slide you were on, you can use the `Advanced Canvas: Continue presentation` command.

</details>

### Usage
- Create the first slide
  - Create the first slide of the presentation using the updated popup menu
  - OR create a node and mark it as the first slide using the updated card menu
- Add more slides
  - Link the slides using arrows
    - If you want to loop back to a previous slide, you can number the arrows in the order you want to navigate through them
  - <b>TIP:</b> Create slides with consistent dimensions by using the updated card menu
- Control the presentation
  - Start the presentation using the command palette (`Advanced Canvas: Start presentation`)
  - Change slides using the arrow keys
  - Exit the presentation using the `ESC` key

## Portals
Embed other canvases inside your canvas and create edges (arrows) to the embedded canvas.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Developer-Mike/obsidian-advanced-canvas/main/assets/sample-portal-usage.png" alt="Portal example"/>

### Usage
- Embed a canvas file and click on the door icon of the popup menu to open a portal

## Collapsible Groups
Collapse and expand groups to organize your canvas.

    <summary>Focus Mode Example</summary>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Developer-Mike/obsidian-advanced-canvas/main/assets/focus-mode.png" alt="Focus Mode"/>
</details>

## Better Readonly
- Disable node popup menus
- Lock the canvas' position
- Lock the canvas' zoom
- BUT to retain some interactivity, it allows zooming to a bounding box (e.g. zoom to selection, zoom to fit all)

### Usage
- Use the updated control menu to toggle the new features (Only shown if the canvas is in readonly mode)

## Encapsulate Selection
Move the current selection to a new canvas and create a link in the current canvas.

### Usage
- Select the nodes you want to encapsulate
- Use the context menu (right click) to encapsulate the selection
- OR use the command palette (`Advanced Canvas: Encapsulate selection`)

## Floating Edges (Automatic Edge Side)
Change the side of the edge automatically to the most suitable side. <br>
Drag the edge to the indicated drop zone inside the node to make the edge float.
