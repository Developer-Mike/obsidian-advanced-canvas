## Presentation Mode
In presentation mode, you can navigate through the nodes using the arrow keys. The diffrent slides/nodes are connected using arrows. If you want to have multiple arrows pointing from the same node, you can number them in the order you want to navigate through them. While in presentation mode, the canvas is in readonly mode (So [better readonly](#better-readonly) effects the presentation mode as well!). You can exit the presentation mode using the `ESC` key.

### Usage
- Create the first slide
  - Create the first slide of the presentation using the [updated popup menu](#node-popup-menu)
  - OR create a node and mark it as the first slide using the [updated card menu](#canvas-card-menu)
- Add more slides
  - Link the slides using arrows
    - If you want to loop back to a previous slide, you can number the arrows in the order you want to navigate through them
  - <b>TIP:</b> Create slides with consistent dimensions by using the [updated card menu](#canvas-card-menu)
- Control the presentation
  - Start the presentation using the command palette (`Advanced Canvas: Start presentation`)
  - Change slides using the arrow keys
  - Exit the presentation using the `ESC` key

## Portals
Embed other canvases inside your canvas and create edges (arrows) to the embedded canvas.

<img src="./assets/sample-portal-usage.png" alt="Portal example"/>

### Usage
- Embed a canvas file and click on the door icon of the popup menu to open a portal

## Better Readonly
- Disable node popup menus
- Lock the canvas' position
- Lock the canvas' zoom
- BUT to retain some interactivity, it allows zooming to a bounding box (e.g. zoom to selection, zoom to fit all)

### Usage
- Use the [updated control menu](#canvas-control-menu) to toggle the new features (Only shown if the canvas is in readonly mode)

## Encapsulate Selection
Move the current selection to a new canvas and create a link in the current canvas.

### Usage
- Select the nodes you want to encapsulate
- Use the context menu (right click) to encapsulate the selection
- OR use the command palette (`Advanced Canvas: Encapsulate selection`)

## Canvas Events
All custom events are prefixed with `advanced-canvas:` and can be listened to using `app.workspace.on` (Just like the default events).
